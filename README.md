# ENMeval
R package for automated runs and evaluations of ecological niche models.

[`ENMeval`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ENMeval) is an R package that performs automated runs and evaluations of ecological niche models, and currently implements [Maxent](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). `ENMeval` was made for those who want to "tune" their models to maximize predictive ability and avoid overfitting, or in other words, optimize model complexity to balance goodness-of-fit and predictive ability. The primary function, `ENMevaluate`, does all the heavy lifting and returns several items including a table of evaluation statistics and, for each setting combination (here, colloquially: *runs*), a model object and a raster layer showing the model prediction across the study extent. There are also options for calculating niche overlap between predictions, running in parallel to speed up computation, and more.
